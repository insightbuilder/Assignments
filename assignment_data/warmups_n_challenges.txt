Suggestion: 
    a) Write functions for doing the required processing
    b) Write atleast 2 test cases for testing out the functions as you code 
    c) Write comments on each step in the functions
- Problems:
    1) Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author.Display the quotation and author as shown in the example
