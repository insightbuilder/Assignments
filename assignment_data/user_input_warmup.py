# warmup that can be executed only as script, so read all the instruction first
# provide appropriate instruction to the user on the format of the input
# ensure the entire script runs, including all logic

# 1 ask user to provide 5 words that can be used as variable name,

# 2 print the vaiable names provided by the user in earlier step

# 3 Check if all the provided variable names are valid python variable names
# Extract those names, that are invalid into invalid_names list, print it

# 4 Extract the variable names that are more than 4 chars into sep1, print it

# 5 ask for the user one variable name, 

# 6 Make the script to continue asking for one more variable name, endlessly

# 7 After breaking from endless loop, now re-write the endless var name request
# with a break condition

# Inform user that, this script can accept command line arguments

# Implement simple logic to check if there is a command line argument

# parse the command line arguments provided by the user in to cli variable

# Implement Logic to check how many c-line args are provided, and ask user to provide minimum 5

# Do the 2 / 3 and 4 instruction above
